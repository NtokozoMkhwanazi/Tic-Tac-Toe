# Tic-Tac-Toe

1.This is a Tic Tac Toe Game using C++ and the SFML library.

2.Only thing i did not include is the play again function i did not see the need because i made it for devs to explore and fool around with the Logic of the Agent current it uses Minimax and there are some cool algorithms we could use for the Logic of the Agent. but currently the Agent is unbeateable trust me i tried  :).

This project is open for Development.
