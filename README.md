# Tic-Tac-Toe

1.This is a Tic Tac Toe Game using C++ and the SFML library.
2.Check out the Game.cpp file, you can play with a friend or with the Agent which is unbeatable unfortunately because of the mininmax algorithm  if you dont trust me run it on your machine just compile it with the sfml library headers included then its good to go ...

g++ -o Game testGame.cpp -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-graphics
